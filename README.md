Hi, I’m Irshath Azeem from Kumbakonam. I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore. I also gained 7 months of internship experience at Volante Technologies, Chennai, where I worked on real-time projects that strengthened my hands-on skills.

I’m passionate about exploring new technologies, and over the years, I have gained proficiency in Java and the MERN stack. I enjoy building solutions that create a meaningful impact. Outside of work, I love playing cricket and spending time with my family and friends.

I’m excited to start this journey with Wall Street English and look forward to learning, growing, and contributing to the team.
